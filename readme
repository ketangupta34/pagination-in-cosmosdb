# Pagination Issue in CosmosDB executable code

## description
In cosmosdb when we try to fetch data using `fetchNext()` we come across some issues. 

## Structure of code
in `src` we have `helpers` and `services`
helper contains a cosmosDB class that utilises the @azure/cosmos to fetch data.
services has a cases class that we utilize in our backend API structure.

In cases.service.ts we have one fucntion `getCaseList()`

this takes in different parameters like sort, filter,search etc. We create a sql query based on these 
inputs and use the `queryContainerNext()` in helper to fetch the data

## setup
1. run `npm install`
2. Import the `TestData.json` to a cosmosDB container.
3. Add the key, url, db name and containerName to env file
4. `npm test` run the test

I have written 6 tests
first has the problem test and rest 5 are to give an idea how we are utilizing it
